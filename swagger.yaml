      With third-party data connectors, you can import assets from other
      platforms into Tenable.io. Tenable.io supports programmatic interaction
      with the following connectors:


      - Amazon Web Services (AWS)

      - Microsoft Azure

      - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)


      Use the API to perform a standard set of CRUD operation on connector
      objects, and then use the connectors to import asset data by scheduling or
      running on-demand import jobs. For background information about
      connectors, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability Management User
      Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/CloudConnectors/Connectors.htm).
  - name: Groups
    description: >-
      With user groups, you can categorize users and manage user permissions to
      Tenable.io resources. When you assign users to a group, the users inherit
      the permissions assigned to the group. Use the API to perform standard
      CRUD operations on group objects, and also to manage users in groups.


      For background information about groups, see [Tenable.io Vulnerability
      Management User
      Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/AccessControl/Groups.htm).
  - name: Users
    description: >-
      User accounts enable you to provide access to Tenable.io and manage
      permissions for Tenable.io resources. You can use the API to perform
      standard CRUD operations on user objects, and also change passwords,
      generate API keys, impersonate users, enable multi-factor authentication,
      and manage access authorizations.


      For background information about managing users, see [Tenable.io
      Vulnerability Management User
      Guide](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Platform/Settings/AccessControl/Users.htm).

        Creates a Tenable.io cloud connector.


        **Note:** For AWS connectors, you can get the available AWS cloudtrails
        for your account via the [POST
        /settings/connectors/aws/cloudtrails](#io-connectors-get-aws-cloudtrails)
        endpoint.


        **Note:** Frictionless Assessment has reached the End-of-Provisioning
        phase of its product lifecycle. For more information, see [Frictionless

                            Tenable.io automatically associates the connector

                            Note: Tenable recommends creating a network for each
                            connector type in use to prevent asset records in
                            different cloud environments from overwriting each

                                disabled (`0`). If enabled, Tenable.io sends the
                                two-factor verification code via e-mail, as well
                                as via the default SMS message.

                            Specifies whether the user can log into the
                            Tenable.io user interface (`0`) or is locked out
                            (`1`).


                            Tenable.io automatically updates this attribute to
                            `1` if the `login_fail_count` attribute for the user
                            is greater than 5. To unlock a user account, reset
                            the user's password using the [PUT
                            /users/{user_id}/chpasswd](ref:users-password)
                            endpoint.


                            **Note:** A user can be locked out of the user
                            interface but still submit API requests if they are
                            assigned the appropriate authorizations
                            (`api_permitted`). To prevent a user from submitting
                            API requests, limit authorizations using the [PUT
                            /users/{user_id}/authorizations](ref:users-update-auths)
                            endpoint, or disable the user entirely using the
                            [PUT /users/{user_id}/enabled](ref:users-enabled)
                            endpoint.

                    a domain approved for your Tenable Vulnerability Management
                    instance. However, a user can update their own `email`
                    property value to have an unapproved domain if an
                    administrator has already approved the domain for that
                    particular user.


                    This email address overrides the email address set in
                    `username`. If your request omits this parameter, Tenable
                    Vulnerability Management uses the `username` value as the
                    user's email address.


                    **Note:** During initial setup, Tenable configures approved
                    domains for your Vulnerability Management instance. To add
                    domains to your instance, contact Tenable Support.
